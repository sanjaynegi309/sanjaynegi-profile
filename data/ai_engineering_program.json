             "Quarterly Review Cadence: Core modules will be reviewed at least quarterly. Minor updates (e.g., API examples) will be pushed as they arise. Major shifts in tooling or best-practice will be covered in dedicated update sessions.",
             "Learner Access: Enrolled learners receive access to updated content for the tracks they are enrolled in. Major curriculum revisions will be accompanied by a live webinar that explains what changed and why.",
             "Principle-First Teaching: While we teach practical tools and frameworks, our curriculum emphasizes enduring engineering principles (prompting logic, evaluation methodology, context engineering, observability, and governance). This ensures skills remain relevant despite tooling changes.",
             "Replacement of Tools: If a better or more popular framework replaces an existing one in a given module, we will adopt the new framework in the live curriculum and provide migration notes and code examples for learners to map old patterns to new ones.",
             "Expert Oversight: All updates are reviewed by our AI engineering faculty and validated against real-world applicability, security, and ethical considerations.",
             "Ethics & Compliance: If new regulatory or ethical frameworks (for example region- or industry-specific guidance) become relevant, they will be integrated promptly into applicable modules.",
             "Communication: Learners will be notified via email/portal of material changes, and a changelog with dates and a short description will be maintained.",
             "Scope: The policy covers curriculum content, example implementations, and recommended tooling. It does not guarantee support for custom third-party integrations beyond the scope of provided labs, but we will provide guidance and migration patterns."
         ],
         "shortPromise": "Tools will evolve. The curriculum will adapt. Your core skills will remain durable — and you’ll be kept up-to-date."
